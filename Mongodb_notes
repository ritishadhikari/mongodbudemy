Mongodb Databases does not contain any schema. 

1. show dbs : Display all the available databases.
2. use shop : Switching to a particular database
3. db.products.insertone({name:'A Book',price:300}) : Inserting a record to the collection products.
4. db.products.find() : To explore the collections.
5. db.products.find().pretty() : To explore the collections in a better looking manner.
 
A collection is equivalent to a table in Mongodb. 

Without creating a record in a database, the database actually don't get created even we are using that database.

Mongodb stores the user input json data into bson data which is much more efficient to use.

It is not necessary that the _id will be generated directly. User can also input the _id manually. The only condition is that the ids in each documents needs to be distinct.

Create -> insertOne(data,options); insertMany(data,options)
Read -> find(filter, options); findOne(filter, options)
Update -> updateOne(filter, data, options); updateMany(filter, data, options); replaceOne(filter, data, options)
Delete -> deleteOne(filter, options); deleteMany(filter, options)

6. db.fightData.deleteOne({"departureAirport": "MUC"}) : Delete a Document from the collection. 
7. db.fightData.updateOne({"departureAirport":"TXL"}, {$set:{"marker":"delete"}}) : Update a Document by entering a new information. Look at the $set command.
8. db.fightData.updateMany({}, {$set:{"marker":"todelete"}}) : Update all the Documents in the collection  by entering a new information.
9. db.fightData.deleteMany({"marker":"todelete"}) : Delete all the document which has marker as delete.
10.db.fightData.insertMany([{"departureAirport":"MUC","arrivalAirport":"SFO","aircraft":"Airport A380","distance":12000,"intercontinental":true},
{"departureAirport":"TXL","arrivalAirport":"LHR","_id":"ritz0607"}]) : Insert Multiple Document in a Collection.
11. db.fightData.find({departureAirport:"TXL"}).pretty() : Find a Document with departureAirport as TXL
12. db.fightData.find({distance:{$gt:10000}}).pretty(): Find a Document with distance greater than 10000

Incase we are using Update command inplace of Updateone or Updatemany, then all the objects are overwritten which is not the case for the later two. Hence we use set command with updateone 
and updatemany.

For replacing more than one object in a document we can also us the replaceone command.
13. db.passengers.find().toArray() : This command shows all the documents unlike Pretty which shows only the first 20 documents.
14. db.passengers.find({},{_id:0,name:1,age:0}): Project only the name from each document. Here _id:0 is mandatory while age:0 is optional.
15. db.passengers.find({"age":35},{"name":1, _id:0}).pretty() : Equivalent to select name from passengers where age=35.

Mongodb support embedded documents. Upto 100 levels of Nesting in each document and maximum of 16 mb per document.
16. db.passengers.findOne({name:"Maria Jones"})["hobbies"] : Select hobbies from passengers where name = 'Maria Jones'

17. db.patientdata.find({"history.0.treatment":"acidity"}) : Command to find for a specific document when we are searching for an embedding document.
18. db.patientdate.drop() : Drop a Collection.
19. db.dropDatabase() : Command to drop a Database after using the Database.

Data Types in Mongodb : 
a. Text : 16 MB per Document
b. Booleans : True/ False
c. Integers : Int32, Int64
d. NumberDecimals : High Precision Floating Point values.
e. objectId : Unique ID containing a temporal component which are successive in order as per the document creation.
f. ISODate : Date Type
g. Timestamp : ex : 11421532
h. Embedded Documents
i. Arrrays : List of strings, Numbers etc.

18. db.stats() : Provides the statistics of the Database.
19. db.numbers.insertOne({a:NumberInt(1)}) : Initialising object a with Mongobd initialized number 1. Also can be included is NUmberLong and NumberDecimal.
 

EMbeddings are necessary when there is a strong one-one document.

We may carry on with embeddings or we may create separate collections and then merge the documents based on some objects.

For One to Many or Many to Many, we may consider referencing as so to mitigate the edit and modifications for individual collections or documents.

20. db.books.aggregate([{$lookup:{from :"authors", localField:"author.auth_id", foreignField: "_id",as:"creators"}}]).pretty() : Use lookup for joining books collection with author collection with alias
name as creators.

We can define rules to validate inserts and update before writing to the database. We need to chose validation level and action based on our application requirements. Lecture 52 and 53. 

21.db.createCollection("post",
{validator:{
   $jsonSchema: {bsonType: "object",
              required : ["title","text","creator", "comment"],

Creating Indexes can drastically speed up our queries.
74. db.contacts.explain().find({"dob.age":{$gt:60}}).count() : Gives the explaination on how Mongodb used to filter the query. Before creating an index, the stage used is Colscan and the time to
scan is considerably higher. Post the indexing the stage used is IXSCAN and the time to scan is considerably lower. 
75. db.contacts.explain("executionStats").find({"dob.age":{$gt:60}}) : Gives the detailed explanation on the time and the total number of records Mondo db used to search and drill down to the 
filtered results.

80. db.contacts.createIndex({"email":1}, {unique:true}}) : Creating an Unique Index based on the email. It will fail incase the email existing in the database are not unique.

Unique Indexes ensure data consistency and ensure avoid duplicate data for fields we need to have unique values. 

81. db.contacts.createIndex({"dob.age" : 1}, {partialFilterExpression:{"gender":"male"}}) : This is the example of a partial indexing which is helpful when only both the conditions are 
searched for. It saves significant space while writing queries. 
82. db.users.createIndex({email:1}, {unique:true, partialFilterExpression:{email:{$exists:true}}}): This function will only create an index for documents which will have an email field. For the
rest of the documents, the insert into this collection will happen even if no email exists but they won't be indexed.
83. db.sessions.createIndex({createdAt:1},{expireAfterSeconds:10}) : expireAfterSeconds is used so that the data is deleted after a prescribed time. It works only with date indexes and works
only on single indexes and not multiindexes.

Diagnosis of queries can be done through : QueryPlanner, executionStats and allPlansExecution. 

Multikey Indexes are used for objects holdings arrays. Note that we cannot hold a compound index with an object holding arrays and another with an object holding singular values. 

84. db.products.createIndex({description:"text"}) : Creating text Indexes by removing all stopwords and storing the text array as keys.
85. db.products.find({$text:{$search:"awesome"}}).pretty() : Post the creation of a text index, when this query is run, it provides all the texts with description object values as awesome.
86. db.products.find({$text:{$search:"\"pretty awesome\""}}).pretty() : Query to search for text with more than one word. Here it searches for the word : pretty awesome.
87. db.products.find({$text:{$search:"awesome T-Shirt"}},{score:{$meta:"textScore"}}).sort({score:{$meta:"textScore"}}).pretty() : This query finds the score of the searched strings from the text
objects and then sorts the scores and displays the list as per the score.
88. db.products.dropIndex("description_text"): Query to drop a text index. This description_text is the name of the index which can be found by querying db.products.getIndex()
89. db.products.createIndex({title:"text", description:"text"}) : We can assign two text objects as an index separately. For this to take place, we need to drop the previous text indexes
and then only assign this multiple object index.
90. db.products.find({$text:{$search:"awesome -book"}}).pretty() : This query will find all the documents which have awesome without the word book attached to the words in the object of the document.
91. db.products.createIndex({title:"text", description:"text"},{default_language:"english", weights:{title:1, description:10}}) : Creates the index and gives weights to different indexes separately. 
With weights searching with a metascore later will give us a different score compared to not assigning weights to the text indexes.
92. db.products.createIndex({title:"text", description:"text"},{default_language:"english", background:true}) : When the background is set to true, then the collection is not occupied. But the
index creation is mush slower. 

Working with GeoJson data with Mongodb requires one to work with GeoJSON objects like Point, Linestring, Polygon, Geometry Collection and etc. 

93. db.places.insertOne({name:"VictoriaMemorial", location:{type:"Point", coordinates:[22.5448131, 88.3403638]}}): Adding a GeoJson Data. The type and co-ordinates are mandatory where the first

The Security checlist in Mongodb are: 
a. Authenticity and Autorization.
b. Transport Encryption.
c. Encryption at Rest.
d. Auditing.

#With the help of replica sets, we can read data from a secondary nodes incase the primary node is offline. But we can write data always from the primary Node only. 

In Sharding, Data is distributed across Shards and queries are run across all shards. Multiple replica sets are created and the client can access all the requats through mongos(Router). 
Each Replica sets are indexed through Shard Keys.

We can use MongoAtlas to connect the Mongo Server to the cloud and do our operations. Quite helpful for deployment purpose.
