Mongodb Databases does not contain any schema. 

1. show dbs : Display all the available databases.
2. use shop : Switching to a particular database
3. db.products.insertone({name:'A Book',price:300}) : Inserting a record to the collection products.
4. db.products.find() : To explore the collections.
5. db.products.find().pretty() : To explore the collections in a better looking manner.
 
A collection is equivalent to a table in Mongodb. 

Without creating a record in a database, the database actually don't get created even we are using that database.

Mongodb stores the user input json data into bson data which is much more efficient to use.

It is not necessary that the _id will be generated directly. User can also input the _id manually. The only condition is that the ids in each documents needs to be distinct.

Create -> insertOne(data,options); insertMany(data,options)
Read -> find(filter, options); findOne(filter, options)
Update -> updateOne(filter, data, options); updateMany(filter, data, options); replaceOne(filter, data, options)
Delete -> deleteOne(filter, options); deleteMany(filter, options)

6. db.fightData.deleteOne({"departureAirport": "MUC"}) : Delete a Document from the collection. 
7. db.fightData.updateOne({"departureAirport":"TXL"}, {$set:{"marker":"delete"}}) : Update a Document by entering a new information. Look at the $set command.
8. db.fightData.updateMany({}, {$set:{"marker":"todelete"}}) : Update all the Documents in the collection  by entering a new information.
9. db.fightData.deleteMany({"marker":"todelete"}) : Delete all the document which has marker as delete.
10.db.fightData.insertMany([{"departureAirport":"MUC","arrivalAirport":"SFO","aircraft":"Airport A380","distance":12000,"intercontinental":true},
{"departureAirport":"TXL","arrivalAirport":"LHR","_id":"ritz0607"}]) : Insert Multiple Document in a Collection.
